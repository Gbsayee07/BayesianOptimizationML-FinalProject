# Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes

This project investigates Bayesian Optimization for efficient hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models.

## Project Overview
- Synthetic benchmark: Branin function
- Real-world benchmarks: SVM and Online LDA hyperparameter tuning
- Gaussian Process modeling with uncertainty
- Expected Improvement acquisition function
- Comparison with Random Search
- Statistical evaluation with paired t-tests
