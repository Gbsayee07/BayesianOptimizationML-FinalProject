Step 1 — Data Visualization

1. Branin Function Heatmap

We began by visualizing the Branin function over the domain
X = [-5, 10] times [0, 15],
using a dense 1000 times 1000 grid. This produces a smooth heatmap showing the global structure of the objective function.

Raw Branin Function

The raw heatmap clearly reveals the three well-known global minima of the Branin function. The function varies significantly across the domain, with values ranging from approximately 0 to over 300. This large dynamic range indicates strong non-stationarity: the smoothness and curvature of the function vary depending on the region.

Log-Transformed Branin

To reduce this non-stationarity, we also plotted a log-transformed version of the Branin function. The transformation compresses the high-value regions and expands low-value regions, producing a more uniform and stationary landscape. This is useful for Gaussian process (GP) modeling since GPs typically assume that the underlying function variation is consistent across the domain.

2. KDE of Benchmark Data (SVM and LDA)

The second part of Step 1 involved examining the real benchmark datasets: SVM and LDA hyperparameter performance grids. Each dataset includes objective values evaluated on a 3D hyperparameter grid. Since the GP will model these objective values directly, we analyzed their 1D distributions.

SVM Dataset

Raw KDE
The raw objective values are heavily skewed, with a sharp peak near 0.28 and a long right tail. This suggests heteroskedasticity and non-Gaussian behavior, which can lead to poorer GP fits.

Transformed KDE
Applying a log transformation yields a smoother, more symmetric distribution. The tail becomes much shorter, and the peak becomes more Gaussian-like. This transformation will likely improve GP modeling by reducing skew and stabilizing variance.

LDA Dataset

Raw KDE
The LDA objective values span a very wide range (roughly 1000–6000) and have a long right tail. The distribution is highly non-Gaussian, with significant skewness and heavy-tailed behavior.

Transformed KDE
A log transform dramatically improves the distribution’s shape. The KDE becomes unimodal, smoother, and more symmetric. Since GP regression assumes a stationary process with reasonably stable variance, this transformation is expected to make the LDA data far easier to model.

3. Interpretation

Overall, the visualizations reveal that:
	•	The raw Branin function is non-stationary, but a log transform makes it more GP-friendly.
	•	Both the SVM and LDA datasets exhibit heavy skew and long tails, which are problematic for GP modeling.
	•	Log transformations significantly improve distributional behavior, making the data closer to the Gaussian assumptions underpinning GP regression.

These visual insights guide the modeling choices in Step 2. The transformed versions will likely produce more stable GP fits, higher marginal likelihoods, and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates.
